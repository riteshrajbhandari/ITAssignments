				<h1>About The Site</h1>
				<br />
				<div class="about">
					This site was made by Ritesh Rajbhandari for the final project of IT.
					It was written in HTML, along with CSS and Javascript.<br /><br />
					HTML or Hyper-Text Markup Language is the stand markup language for
					creating documents designed to be viewed in a web browser. The now
					standard version called HTML5 brings in features that not only makes
					it easier to better optimize web pages, but it also contains lots to
					tools to make the end-user's experience better.<br /><br />
					CSS or Cascading Style Sheets are basically templates to build your
					website off of. It describes how each HTML is displayed and it can all
					be controlled according to your need. It saves a lot of time while
					developing by allowing to use one single style throughout the website
					consistently without having to worry about applying the design to
					individual pages.<br /><br />
					Javascript is a scripting language for the web that enables us to
					create interactive web interfaces. It, in conjunction with CSS and
					HTML, is used to define the client-side page behaviour and the front
					end of the site.

				<h1>About The Band</h1>
				<br />
				<div class="about">
					Linkin Park is a rock band that is heavily influenced by the genres of
					hip-hop and rap. Their first studio album <b>Hybrid Theory</b> was an
					instant hit all around the world. Since then the band has constantly
					experimented with mixing new and different elements together to create
					unique records every time. This is all the more noticeable in their
					latest album <b>One More Light</b>, in which rapper and songwriter
					Mike Shinoda stated the band was following a new process when
					producing the album. Brad Delson, the guitarist, elaborated: "We've
					made so many records and we clearly know how to make a record and we
					definitely didn't take the easy way out this time."<br /><br />
					The band has been on a hiatus since then, but on April of 2020,
					bassist Dave Farrel revealed that the band is, in fact, working on new
					music currently.
